**The Digital Footprint: Analyzing the Impact of Social Media**

**Summary**

In today's interconnected world, social media has become more than just a tool for communicationâ€”it's a pervasive force shaping our lives. This project is my data-driven journey to understand that force. Using a survey, I have analyzed how social media impacts various aspects of life, from personal relationships to mental well-being. This repository contains the data, a project file, and insights from that exploration.

**The Project: From Survey to Story**

The goal was to transform raw survey responses into a compelling narrative. I started with a dataset of survey results and, using the power of Power BI, cleaned and prepared the data for analysis. The core of this project is the dashboard itself, where I looked for patterns, correlations, and key insights to paint a picture of social media's impact on a variety of demographics.

**What's Inside**

social_media_survey_data.csv: This is the raw dataset collected from the survey. It's the foundation of my analysis, containing all the anonymous responses.
Social_Media_Impact_Analysis.pbix: This is the Power BI project file. It contains all the data connections, transformations, and the final dashboard visualizations. It is the heart of the project.
visualizations/: This folder contains the key charts and graphs generated during the analysis. These images provide a visual summary of the findings, such as the relationship between screen time and feelings of loneliness, or which platforms are most popular among different age groups.

**Key Discoveries**

Through this analysis, I've uncovered some fascinating insights, including:
Time Spent Online: How many hours do people spend on social media each day, and how does this vary by age?
Mental Health Connections: What is the perceived impact of social media on mental health and self-esteem?
Social Connections: How do people feel social media affects their face-to-face relationships?
Platform Preferences: Which social media platforms are most prevalent in different user groups?
These findings offer a glimpse into the complex relationship we have with our digital world and can be a starting point for further research or personal reflection.

**Tech Stack**

Power BI: The primary tool used for data cleaning, modeling, and creating the interactive dashboard.
